# Lecture 2, January 10, 2024

In this lecture, we went over some basic definitions from the set theory, and using them as the building block for the rest of the course. We started Chapter 2 today, with many definitions.

As for the set operations, $\cup,\cap,A^c,...$, the Venn diagrams help to visual the meaning behind. Here is a good reference [HERE](https://www.edrawmax.com/article/venn-diagram-symbols-and-set-notations.html).

::: {.definition name="sample space"}
A **sample space** $S$ is a **set** of distinct outcomes of an experiment with the property that in a single trial of the experiment only one of these outcomes occurs.
:::

::: {.definition name="Discrete and non-discrete sample space"}
A sample space $S$ is said to be **discrete** if it is finite, or ``countably infinite"  (i.e.,there is a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers). Otherwise a sample space is said to be **non-discrete**.
:::

::: {.definition name="Event"}
An **event** is a subset of the sample space that can be assigned probability. 
:::
::: {.definition name="Simple/Compound event"}
Let $S$ be discrete and $A\subset S$ an event. If $A$ is indivisible so it contains only one point, we call it a **simple event**, otherwise **compound event**. 
:::

::: {.definition name="Probability distribution"}
Let $S=\{a_1,a_2,\dots\}$ be discrete. Assign numbers $P(\{a_i\})$ (or short: $P(a_i)$), $i=1,2,\dots$, so that

1.$0\leq P(a_i)\leq 1,\quad i=1,2,\dots$
2. $\sum_{\text{all }i}P(a_i)=1$. 

We then call the set of probabilities $\{P(a_i):i=1,2,\dots\}$ a **probability distribution**.
:::

::: {.definition}
Let $S=\{a_1,a_2,\dots\}$ discrete. From any prob. distribution $P$ on $S$ we can define a prob. measure on $ {\mathcal S} = 2^S$ (set of all subsets of  $S$) by
$$\forall A \subseteq S \qquad P(A)=\sum_{a_i\in A}P(a_i).$$ 
:::

::: {.definition name="Equally likely"}
We say a sample space $S$ with a finite number of outcomes is **equally likely** if the probability of every individual outcome in $S$ is the same.
