The purpose of this page is to hold some of the additional materials provided by myself. Students should consult UW \href{https://api-4ccc589b.duosecurity.com/frame/v4/preauth/healthcheck?sid=frameless-c0657e9d-cb86-4ac9-a6a7-fd054ae21fd5}{Learn} system.

\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course description}\label{course-description}}

This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events, conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions, marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities.

  Chapter 1 -- Basic definition of probability. We also saw the potential ambiguities when defining probabilities.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{definition}[Classical Definition of probability]
The \textbf{classical} definition: The probability of some event is
\[
\frac{\mathrm{number~of~ways~the~event~can~occur~}}
{\mathrm{{the~total~number~of~possible~outcomes}}},
\]
provided all outcomes are \emph{equally likely}.
\end{definition}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{definition}[Relative Frequency Definition of of probability]
The \textbf{relative frequency} definition: The probability of an event
is the (limiting) proportion (or fraction) of times the event occurs in a very
long series of repetitions of an experiment.
\end{definition}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{definition}[Subjective Definition of Probability]
The \textbf{subjective} definition: The probability of an event is a measure of how sure the person making the statement is that the event will happen.
\end{definition}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Problem}: Each of the above definitions has pitfall:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Classical: We may not be able to know the total number of possible outcomes, or it may be uncountable
\item
  Relative frequency: We need ``repetition'', which is often expensive and may not be possible.
\item
  Subjective: We want the probability to be consistent across different people, and and be rigorously defined.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{lecture-2-january-10-2024}{%
\chapter{Lecture 2, January 10, 2024}\label{lecture-2-january-10-2024}}

In this lecture, we went over some basic definitions from the set theory, and using them as the building block for the rest of the course. We started Chapter 2 today, with many definitions.

As for the set operations, \(\cup,\cap,A^c,...\), the Venn diagrams help to visual the meaning behind. Here is a good reference \href{https://www.edrawmax.com/article/venn-diagram-symbols-and-set-notations.html}{HERE}.

\begin{definition}[sample space]
A \textbf{sample space} \(S\) is a \emph{set} of distinct outcomes of an experiment with the property that in a single trial of the experiment only one of these outcomes occurs.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Discrete and non-discrete sample space]
A sample space \(S\) is said to be \textbf{discrete} if it is finite, or ``countably infinite'' (i.e.,there is a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers). Otherwise a sample space is said to be \textbf{non-discrete}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Event]
An \textbf{event} is a subset of the sample space that can be assigned probability.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Simple and Compound event]
Let \(S\) be discrete and \(A\subset S\) an event. If \(A\) is indivisible so it contains only one point, we call it a \textbf{simple event}, otherwise \textbf{compound event}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Probability distribution]
Let \(S=\{a_1,a_2,\dots\}\) be discrete. Assign numbers \(P(\{a_i\})\) (or short: \(P(a_i)\)), \(i=1,2,\dots\), so that

1.\(0\leq P(a_i)\leq 1,\quad i=1,2,\dots\)
2. \(\sum_{\text{all }i}P(a_i)=1\).

We then call the set of probabilities \(\{P(a_i):i=1,2,\dots\}\) a \textbf{probability distribution}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let \(S=\{a_1,a_2,\dots\}\) discrete. From any prob. distribution \(P\) on \(S\) we can define a prob. measure on \$ \{\mathcal S\} = 2\^{}S\$ (set of all subsets of \(S\)) by
\[\forall A \subseteq S \qquad P(A)=\sum_{a_i\in A}P(a_i).\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Equally likely]
We say a sample space \(S\) with a finite number of outcomes is \textbf{equally likely} if the probability of every individual outcome in \(S\) is the same.
\end{definition}

Observe that

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(|A|\) denote the number of outcomes in an event \(A\). In case of an equally likely sample space,
  \[
  1=P(S)=\sum_{i=1}^{|S|}P(a_{i})= P(a_i)|S|.
  \]
  \[
  P(a_i)=\frac{1}{|S|}.
  \]
\item
  Hence,
  \[P(A) = \sum_{i:\;a_i \in A} P(a_i) = \sum_{i:\;a_i \in A} \frac{1}{|S|} =|A|\cdot  \frac{1}{|S|}\]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion}: In a \textbf{finite, equally likely sample space}, the probability of an event \(A\) can be computed as
\[
P(A) = \sum_{i:\;a_i \in A} P(a_i) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}.
\]

\section{Questions from the class}\label{questions-from-the-class}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the difference between ``countably infinite'' v.s. ``infinite''?
\end{enumerate}

Ans: A set is \emph{countably infinite} if its elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\). Alternatively, you can think that a set is countably infinite if you can count off all elements in the set in such a way that, even though the counting will take forever, you will get to any particular element in a finite amount of time. {[}\href{https://mathinsight.org/definition/countably_infinite}{A good reference page to read}{]}. If a set is not countable or countably infinite, it is infinite.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Why do we have something such as \(2^\mathcal{S}\) in the lecture?
\end{enumerate}

Ans: It is related to something called the \emph{power set}. The power set consists all the possible subset of a set \(\mathcal{S}\). In a subset of \(S\), (i.e.~\(A \subseteq \mathcal{S}\), every element in \(\mathcal{S}\) may be either in \(A\) or not in \(A\). Which means, each element has two possibilities, in \(A\) or not in \(A\). Hence, the cardinality (i.e.~the size) of the power set is \(2^\mathcal{S}\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  What did we mean by ``order does not matter'' and ``order matters'' during the lecture.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Order does not matter: I said when you write out the element of a set, the order does not matter. For instance, in the rolling a six-sided dice, which side would be faced on the top example, we can write \(\mathcal{S} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\), or \(\mathcal{S}^\prime=\{6,5,4,3,2,1\}\), and those two sets are essentially equal to each other. To represent a set, the order does not matter, but we tend to write in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand.
\item
  Order does matter: In rolling two dices example, the dots show on each of the dice is an \emph{ordered pair}, denoted by \((x,y)\). Hence, for instance, \((1,2)\) and \((2,1)\) are different. It is problem-dependent so be careful.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{lecture-3-january-12-2024}{%
\chapter{Lecture 3, January 12, 2024}\label{lecture-3-january-12-2024}}

\begin{definition}[Odds]
Odds \textbf{in favour} of an event \(A\) occurring is
\[
  O(A) := \frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}.
\]
Odds again an event \(A\) is
\[
  \frac{1-P(A)}{P(A)}.
\]
\end{definition}

The range of the odds is \([0,\infty)\).

It provide a measure of the likelihood of a particular outcome to happen.

Abbreviation: ````p:q''.

Note: Probability may be defined through the odds as follow.
\begin{align*}
  &O(A) := \frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)} \\
  &\implies O(A) - P(A)O(A) = P(A) \\
  &\implies O(A) = P(A) (1+O(A)) \\
  &\implies P(A) = \frac{O(A)} {1+O(A)}
\end{align*}

Note: In finite, equally likely sample spaces, computing probabilities amounts to \emph{counting the number of elements in a set}. It will often be difficult to do this manually, so we are looking for clever \emph{counting techniques} in the next chapter.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Chapter 3 Counting Techniques}

Addition rule v.s. Multiplication rule

For addition rule

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Keyword for addition rule is ``\textbf{OR}'';
\item
  \(|A|\) is defined to be the size of the set, aka the cardinality of the set.
\item
  If \(A\) and \(B\) are \emph{disjoint} (i.e.~\(A\cap B = \emptyset\)), then \(|A\cup B| = |A| + |B|\).
\item
  \(A\cup A^c = S\) where \(A \cap A^c = \emptyset\). Thus \(|S|=|A|+|A^c|\).
\end{itemize}

For multiplication rule

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  for multiplication rule is ``\textbf{AND}''
\item
  An ordered k-tuple is an ordered set of \(k\) values: \((a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k)\). If the outcomes in A can be wrttien as an ordered k-tuple where there are \(n_1\) choices for \(a_1\), \(n_2\) choices for \(a_2,\dots\) and in general \(n_i\) choices for \(a_i\), then
  \[
  |A| = n_1n_2\cdots n_k = \prod_{i=1}^k n_i.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{definition}[Factorial]
Given \(n\) distinct objects, there are
\[
n! = n \times (n-1) \times \ldots 2 \times 1,
\]
different ordered arrangements of length \(n\) that can be made. Note that, we define, \(0! = 1\).
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We pronounce \(n!\) as ``n factorial''.
\item
  The following recursive definition is useful:
  \[ 
  n! = n \cdot (n-1)!
  \]

  \item

  When working with factorials, we can often cancel terms, e.g.,
  \[ \frac{9!}{7!} = \frac{9\cdot 8 \cdot 7\cdot 6 \cdot \dots \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{7\cdot 6 \cdot \dots \cdot 2 \cdot 1}=9\cdot 8 = 72\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{definition}[Permutation]
Given \(n\) distinct objects, a \textbf{permutation} of size \(k\) is an \(ordered\) subset of \(k\) of the individuals. The number of permutations of size \(k\) taken from \(n\) objects is denoted \(n^{(k)}\) and
\[
n^{(k)}=n(n-1)\dots (n-k+1) =\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.
\]
\end{definition}

The tricky part of this definition is the word ``ordered''. An ordering need not be numerical, for example assigning labels like ``President'' and ``Vice-President'' has the effect of ordering the individuals.

\hypertarget{questions-from-the-class-1}{%
\section{Questions from the class}\label{questions-from-the-class-1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Can we express the odds as \(a:b\)?
\end{enumerate}

YES. For instance, the example we saw in class (or the clicker question 1), if we roll a fair six sided dice, and let our event \(A:=\{\text{# is } 5 \}\). Then the odds \(O(A)=\frac{1/6}{1/5}=\frac{1}{5}\). We can see that, there is exactly one possibility we have event \(A\), whereas there are 5 possibilities that \(A\) does not happen (i.e.~the number we roll out is \(1,2,3,4,6\)). We \textbf{can} abbreviate it as ``1:5''. For a good example of Odds, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds}{WIKI} provides a good one.

\hypertarget{lecture-4-january-15-2024}{%
\chapter{Lecture 4, January 15, 2024}\label{lecture-4-january-15-2024}}

\begin{definition}[Combination]
Given \(n\) distinct objects, a \emph{combination} of size \(k\) is an \emph{unordered} subset of \(k\) of the individuals. The number of combinations of size \(k\) taken from \(n\) objects is denoted \({n \choose k}\) or \({}_n C_k\) and can be computed as
\[
{n \choose k}=\frac{n^{(k)}}{k!}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\ k!}.
\]
