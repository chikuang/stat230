::: {.definition name="Combination"}
Given $n$ distinct objects, a *combination* of size $k$ is an *unordered* subset of $k$ of the individuals. The number of combinations of size $k$ taken from $n$ objects is denoted ${n \choose k}$ or ${}_n C_k$ and can be computed as
$$
{n \choose k}=\frac{n^{(k)}}{k!}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\ k!}.
