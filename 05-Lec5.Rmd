Properties of the Binomial coefficients


There are some useful/important results about permutation and combination.

1. $n^{(k)} = n (n - 1)^{(k-1)}$ for $k \geq 1$
2. ${n \choose k} = \frac{n^{(k)}}{k!}$
3. ${n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}$ for $k \geq 0$
4. ${n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}$
5. Binomial theorem: $(1 + x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} x^k$
6. ${n \choose k}$ is equal to the $k$th entry in the $n$th row of **Pascal's triangle**.

Aside: Stirling's formula

$n!$ grows really fast as $n$ increases, so sometimes we need to approximate its value for computational reasons.

**Stirling's formula** provides one such method, and it is given by
    
$$
n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n,
$$
where $\sim$ means their ratio approaches 1 as $n$ goes to infinity.

We won't need this approximation, but it's useful to know it exists. 

Example of use:
    Show that  $2^{-2n}\binom{2n}{n} \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi n}}$

::: {.definition name="Multinomial Coefficient"}
Consider $n$ objects which consist of $k$ types. Suppose that there are $n_1$ objects which are of type 1, $n_2$ which are of type 2, and in general $n_i$ objects of type $i$. Then there are
$$
\frac{n!}{n_1 ! n_2! \dots n_k !}
$$
distinguishable arrangements of the $n$ objects. This quantity is known as a **multinomial coefficient** and denoted by 
$$
\binom{n}{n_1,n_2,\dots,n_k}= \frac{n !}{n_1 ! n_2! \dots n_k !}.
