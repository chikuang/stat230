We begin **Chapter 5** in this lecture!

### Chapter 5. Discrete Random Variable

::: {.theorem name="Random Variable"}
A *random variable* is a function that maps assigns a real number $\mathbb{R}$ to each point in a sample space $S$. That is, $X$ is a random variable if 
$$X:S\to \mathbb{R}$$.
:::

::: {.theorem name="Range"}
The values that a random variables takes is called the *range* of the random variable. We often denote the range of a random variable $X$ by $X(S)$.
:::

::: {.theorem name="Discrete random variable"}
The *discrete random variables take integer values, or more generally, values in a countable set (i.e. finite or countably infinite set). That is, its range is a discrete/countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$.
