Students should consult UW Learn system. 1.1 Course description This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events, conditional probability and Bayes’ Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions, marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities. 1.1.1 Instructor Chi-Kuang Yeh, I am a postdoc at the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science. Office: M3–3102 Desk 10.

We started Chapter 2 today, with many definitions. As for the set operations, \\(\\cup,\\cap,A^c,...\\), the Venn diagrams help to visual the meaning behind. Here is a good reference HERE. Definition 3.1 (sample space) A sample space \\(S\\) is a set of distinct outcomes of an experiment with the property that in a single trial of the experiment only one of these outcomes occurs. Definition 3.2 (Discrete and non-discrete sample space) A sample space \\(S\\) is said to be discrete if it is finite, or ``countably infinite” (i.e.,there is a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers). Otherwise a sample space is said to be non-discrete. Definition 3.3 (Event) An event is a subset of the sample space that can be assigned probability. Definition 3.4 (Simple/Compound event) Let \\(S\\) be discrete and \\(A\\subset S\\) an event. If \\(A\\) is indivisible so it contains only one point, we call it a simple event, otherwise compound event. Definition 3.5 (Probability distribution) Let \\(S=\\{a_1,a_2,\\dots\\}\\) be discrete. Assign numbers \\(P(\\{a_i\\})\\) (or short: \\(P(a_i)\\)), \\(i=1,2,\\dots\\), so that 1.\\(0\\leq P(a_i)\\leq 1,\\quad i=1,2,\\dots\\) 2. \\(\\sum_{\\text{all }i}P(a_i)=1\\). We then call the set of probabilities \\(\\{P(a_i):i=1,2,\\dots\\}\\) a probability distribution. Definition 3.6 Let \\(S=\\{a_1,a_2,\\dots\\}\\) discrete. From any prob. distribution \\(P\\) on \\(S\\) we can define a prob. measure on $ {S} = 2^S$ (set of all subsets of \\(S\\)) by \\[\\forall A \\subseteq S \\qquad P(A)=\\sum_{a_i\\in A}P(a_i).\\] Definition 3.7 (Equally likely) We say a sample space \\(S\\) with a finite number of outcomes is equally likely if the probability of every individual outcome in \\(S\\) is the same.
