Students should consult UW Learn system. 1.1 Course description This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events, conditional probability and Bayes’ Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions, marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities. 1.1.1 Instructor Chi-Kuang Yeh, I am a postdoc at the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science. Office: M3–3102 Desk 10.

We started Chapter 2 today, with many definitions. As for the set operations, \\(\\cup,\\cap,A^c,...\\), the Venn diagrams help to visual the meaning behind. Here is a good reference HERE. Definition 3.1 (sample space) A sample space \\(S\\) is a set of distinct outcomes of an experiment with the property that in a single trial of the experiment only one of these outcomes occurs. Definition 3.2 (Discrete and non-discrete sample space) A sample space \\(S\\) is said to be discrete if it is finite, or ``countably infinite” (i.e.,there is a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers). Otherwise a sample space is said to be non-discrete. Definition 3.3 (Event) An event is a subset of the sample space that can be assigned probability. Definition 3.4 (Simple/Compound event) Let \\(S\\) be discrete and \\(A\\subset S\\) an event. If \\(A\\) is indivisible so it contains only one point, we call it a simple event, otherwise compound event. Definition 3.5 (Probability distribution) Let \\(S=\\{a_1,a_2,\\dots\\}\\) be discrete. Assign numbers \\(P(\\{a_i\\})\\) (or short: \\(P(a_i)\\)), \\(i=1,2,\\dots\\), so that 1.\\(0\\leq P(a_i)\\leq 1,\\quad i=1,2,\\dots\\) 2. \\(\\sum_{\\text{all }i}P(a_i)=1\\). We then call the set of probabilities \\(\\{P(a_i):i=1,2,\\dots\\}\\) a probability distribution. Definition 3.6 Let \\(S=\\{a_1,a_2,\\dots\\}\\) discrete. From any prob. distribution \\(P\\) on \\(S\\) we can define a prob. measure on $ {S} = 2^S$ (set of all subsets of \\(S\\)) by \\[\\forall A \\subseteq S \\qquad P(A)=\\sum_{a_i\\in A}P(a_i).\\] Definition 3.7 (Equally likely) We say a sample space \\(S\\) with a finite number of outcomes is equally likely if the probability of every individual outcome in \\(S\\) is the same. Observe that If \\(|A|\\) denote the number of outcomes in an event \\(A\\). In case of an equally likely sample space, \\[ 1=P(S)=\\sum_{i=1}^{|S|}P(a_{i})= P(a_i)|S|. \\] \\[ P(a_i)=\\frac{1}{|S|}. \\] Hence, \\[P(A) = \\sum_{i:\\;a_i \\in A} P(a_i) = \\sum_{i:\\;a_i \\in A} \\frac{1}{|S|} =|A|\\cdot \\frac{1}{|S|}\\] Conclusion: In a finite, equally likely sample space, the probability of an event \\(A\\) can be computed as \\[ P(A) = \\sum_{i:\\;a_i \\in A} P(a_i) = \\frac{|A|}{|S|}. \\] 3.1 Questions from the class What is the difference between “countably infinite” v.s. “infinite”? Ans: A set is countably infinite if its elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Alternatively, you can think that a set is countably infinite if you can count off all elements in the set in such a way that, even though the counting will take forever, you will get to any particular element in a finite amount of time. [A good reference page to read]. If a set is not countable or countably infinite, it is infinite. Why do we have something such as \\(2^\\mathcal{S}\\) in the lecture? Ans: It is related to something called the power set. The power set consists all the possible subset of a set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). In a subset of \\(S\\), (i.e. \\(A \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}\\), every element in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) may be either in \\(A\\) or not in \\(A\\). Which means, each element has two possibilities, in \\(A\\) or not in \\(A\\). Hence, the cardinality (i.e. the size) of the power set is \\(2^\\mathcal{S}\\). What did we mean by “order does not matter” and “order matters” during the lecture. Order does not matter: I said when you write out the element of a set, the order does not matter. For instance, in the rolling a six-sided dice, which side would be faced on the top example, we can write \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\), or \\(\\mathcal{S}^\\prime=\\{6,5,4,3,2,1\\}\\), and those two sets are essentially equal to each other. To represent a set, the order does not matter, but we tend to write in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand. Order does matter: In rolling two dices example, the dots show on each of the dice is an ordered pair, denoted by \\((x,y)\\). Hence, for instance, \\((1,2)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are different. It is problem-dependent so be careful. "],["lecture-3-january-12-2024.html", "4 Lecture 3, January 12, 2024", " 4 Lecture 3, January 12, 2024 Definition 4.1 (Odds) Odds in favour of an event \\(A\\) occuring is \\[ \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}. \\] Odds again an event \\(A\\) is \\[ \\frac{1-P(A)}{P(A)}. \\] Note: In finite, equally likely sample spaces, computing probabilities amounts to counting the number of elements in a set. It will often be difficult to do this manually, so we are looking for clever counting techniques in the next chapter. Chapter 3 Counting Techniques Definition 4.2 (Permutation) Given \\(n\\) distinct objects, a of size \\(k\\) is an \\(ordered\\) subset of \\(k\\) of the individuals. The number of permutations of size \\(k\\) taken from \\(n\\) objects is denoted \\(n^{(k)}\\) and \\[ n^{(k)}=n(n-1)\\dots (n-k+1) =\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}. \\] The tricky part of this definition is the word “ordered”. An ordering need not be numerical, for example assigning labels like “President” and “Vice-President” has the effect of ordering the individuals.
