Students should consult UW Learn system. 1.1 Course description This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events, conditional probability and Bayes’ Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions, marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities. 1.1.1 Instructor Chi-Kuang Yeh, I am a postdoc at the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science.

We also saw the potential ambiguities when defining probabilities. Definition 2.1 (Classical Definition of probability) The classical definition: The probability of some event is \\[ \\frac{\\mathrm{number~of~ways~the~event~can~occur~}} {\\mathrm{{the~total~number~of~possible~outcomes}}}, \\] provided all outcomes are equally likely. Definition 2.2 (Relative Frequency Definition of of probability) The relative frequency definition: The probability of an event is the (limiting) proportion (or fraction) of times the event occurs in a very long series of repetitions of an experiment. Definition 2.3 (Subjective Definition of Probability) The subjective definition: The probability of an event is a measure of how sure the person making the statement is that the event will happen. Problem: Each of the above definitions has pitfall: Classical: We may not be able to know the total number of possible outcomes, or it may be uncountable Relative frequency: We need “repetition”, which is often expensive and may not be possible. Subjective: We want the probability to be consistent across different people, and and be rigorously defined. "],["lecture-2-january-10-2024.html", "3 Lecture 2, January 10, 2024 3.1 Questions from the class", " 3 Lecture 2, January 10, 2024 In this lecture, we went over some basic definitions from the set theory, and using them as the building block for the rest of the course. We started Chapter 2 today, with many definitions. As for the set operations, \\(\\cup,\\cap,A^c,...\\), the Venn diagrams help to visual the meaning behind. Here is a good reference HERE. Definition 3.1 (sample space) A sample space \\(S\\) is a set of distinct outcomes of an experiment with the property that in a single trial of the experiment only one of these outcomes occurs. Definition 3.2 (Discrete and non-discrete sample space) A sample space \\(S\\) is said to be discrete if it is finite, or ``countably infinite” (i.e.,there is a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers). Otherwise a sample space is said to be non-discrete. Definition 3.3 (Event) An event is a subset of the sample space that can be assigned probability. Definition 3.4 (Simple and Compound event) Let \\(S\\) be discrete and \\(A\\subset S\\) an event. If \\(A\\) is indivisible so it contains only one point, we call it a simple event, otherwise compound event. Definition 3.5 (Probability distribution) Let \\(S=\\{a_1,a_2,\\dots\\}\\) be discrete. Assign numbers \\(P(\\{a_i\\})\\) (or short: \\(P(a_i)\\)), \\(i=1,2,\\dots\\), so that 1.\\(0\\leq P(a_i)\\leq 1,\\quad i=1,2,\\dots\\) 2. \\(\\sum_{\\text{all }i}P(a_i)=1\\). We then call the set of probabilities \\(\\{P(a_i):i=1,2,\\dots\\}\\) a probability distribution. Definition 3.6 Let \\(S=\\{a_1,a_2,\\dots\\}\\) discrete. From any prob. distribution \\(P\\) on \\(S\\) we can define a prob. measure on $ {S} = 2^S$ (set of all subsets of \\(S\\)) by \\[\\forall A \\subseteq S \\qquad P(A)=\\sum_{a_i\\in A}P(a_i).\\] Definition 3.7 (Equally likely) We say a sample space \\(S\\) with a finite number of outcomes is equally likely if the probability of every individual outcome in \\(S\\) is the same. Observe that If \\(|A|\\) denote the number of outcomes in an event \\(A\\). In case of an equally likely sample space, \\[ 1=P(S)=\\sum_{i=1}^{|S|}P(a_{i})= P(a_i)|S|. \\] \\[ P(a_i)=\\frac{1}{|S|}. \\] Hence, \\[P(A) = \\sum_{i:\\;a_i \\in A} P(a_i) = \\sum_{i:\\;a_i \\in A} \\frac{1}{|S|} =|A|\\cdot \\frac{1}{|S|}\\] Conclusion: In a finite, equally likely sample space, the probability of an event \\(A\\) can be computed as \\[ P(A) = \\sum_{i:\\;a_i \\in A} P(a_i) = \\frac{|A|}{|S|}. \\] 3.1 Questions from the class What is the difference between “countably infinite” v.s. “infinite”? Ans: A set is countably infinite if its elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Alternatively, you can think that a set is countably infinite if you can count off all elements in the set in such a way that, even though the counting will take forever, you will get to any particular element in a finite amount of time. [A good reference page to read]. If a set is not countable or countably infinite, it is infinite. Why do we have something such as \\(2^\\mathcal{S}\\) in the lecture? Ans: It is related to something called the power set. The power set consists all the possible subset of a set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). In a subset of \\(S\\), (i.e. \\(A \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}\\), every element in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) may be either in \\(A\\) or not in \\(A\\). Which means, each element has two possibilities, in \\(A\\) or not in \\(A\\). Hence, the cardinality (i.e. the size) of the power set is \\(2^\\mathcal{S}\\). What did we mean by “order does not matter” and “order matters” during the lecture. Order does not matter: I said when you write out the element of a set, the order does not matter. For instance, in the rolling a six-sided dice, which side would be faced on the top example, we can write \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\), or \\(\\mathcal{S}^\\prime=\\{6,5,4,3,2,1\\}\\), and those two sets are essentially equal to each other. To represent a set, the order does not matter, but we tend to write in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand. Order does matter: In rolling two dices example, the dots show on each of the dice is an ordered pair, denoted by \\((x,y)\\). Hence, for instance, \\((1,2)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are different. It is problem-dependent so be careful. "],["lecture-3-january-12-2024.html", "4 Lecture 3, January 12, 2024 4.1 Questions from the class", " 4 Lecture 3, January 12, 2024 Definition 4.1 (Odds) Odds in favour of an event \\(A\\) occurring is \\[ O(A) := \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}. \\] Odds again an event \\(A\\) is \\[ \\frac{1-P(A)}{P(A)}. \\] The range of the odds is \\([0,\\infty)\\). It provide a measure of the likelihood of a particular outcome to happen. Abbreviation: ““p:q”. Note: Probability may be defined through the odds as follow. \\[\\begin{align*} &amp;O(A) := \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)} \\\\ &amp;\\implies O(A) - P(A)O(A) = P(A) \\\\ &amp;\\implies O(A) = P(A) (1+O(A)) \\\\ &amp;\\implies P(A) = \\frac{O(A)} {1+O(A)} \\end{align*}\\] Note: In finite, equally likely sample spaces, computing probabilities amounts to counting the number of elements in a set. It will often be difficult to do this manually, so we are looking for clever counting techniques in the next chapter. Chapter 3 Counting Techniques Addition rule v.s. Multiplication rule For addition rule Keyword for addition rule is “OR”; \\(|A|\\) is defined to be the size of the set, aka the cardinality of the set. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint (i.e. \\(A\\cap B = \\emptyset\\)), then \\(|A\\cup B| = |A| + |B|\\). \\(A\\cup A^c = S\\) where \\(A \\cap A^c = \\emptyset\\). Thus \\(|S|=|A|+|A^c|\\). For multiplication rule for multiplication rule is “AND” An ordered k-tuple is an ordered set of \\(k\\) values: \\((a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_k)\\). If the outcomes in A can be wrttien as an ordered k-tuple where there are \\(n_1\\) choices for \\(a_1\\), \\(n_2\\) choices for \\(a_2,\\dots\\) and in general \\(n_i\\) choices for \\(a_i\\), then \\[ |A| = n_1n_2\\cdots n_k = \\prod_{i=1}^k n_i. \\] Definition 4.2 (Factorial) Given \\(n\\) distinct objects, there are \\[ n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times \\ldots 2 \\times 1, \\] different ordered arrangements of length \\(n\\) that can be made. Note that, we define, \\(0! = 1\\). We pronounce \\(n!\\) as “n factorial”. The following recursive definition is useful: \\[ n! = n \\cdot (n-1)! \\] When working with factorials, we can often cancel terms, e.g., \\[ \\frac{9!}{7!} = \\frac{9\\cdot 8 \\cdot 7\\cdot 6 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{7\\cdot 6 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}=9\\cdot 8 = 72\\] Definition 4.3 (Permutation) Given \\(n\\) distinct objects, a permutation of size \\(k\\) is an \\(ordered\\) subset of \\(k\\) of the individuals. The number of permutations of size \\(k\\) taken from \\(n\\) objects is denoted \\(n^{(k)}\\) and \\[ n^{(k)}=n(n-1)\\dots (n-k+1) =\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}. \\] The tricky part of this definition is the word “ordered”. An ordering need not be numerical, for example assigning labels like “President” and “Vice-President” has the effect of ordering the individuals. 4.1 Questions from the class Can we express the odds as \\(a:b\\)? YES. For instance, the example we saw in class (or the clicker question 1), if we roll a fair six sided dice, and let our event \\(A:=\\{\\text{# is } 5 \\}\\). Then the odds \\(O(A)=\\frac{1/6}{1/5}=\\frac{1}{5}\\). We can see that, there is exactly one possibility we have event \\(A\\), whereas there are 5 possibilities that \\(A\\) does not happen (i.e. the number we roll out is \\(1,2,3,4,6\\)). We can abbreviate it as “1:5”. For a good example of Odds, WIKI provides a good one.

The number of combinations of size \\(k\\) taken from \\(n\\) objects is denoted \\({n \\choose k}\\) or \\({}_n C_k\\) and can be computed as \\[ {n \\choose k}=\\frac{n^{(k)}}{k!}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\ k!}. \\] "],["lecture-5-january-17-2024.html", "6 Lecture 5, January 17, 2024 6.1 Example in class", " 6 Lecture 5, January 17, 2024 Properties of the Binomial coefficients There are some useful/important results about permutation and combination. \\(n^{(k)} = n (n - 1)^{(k-1)}\\) for \\(k \\geq 1\\) \\({n \\choose k} = \\frac{n^{(k)}}{k!}\\) \\({n \\choose k} = {n \\choose n-k}\\) for \\(k \\geq 0\\) \\({n \\choose k} = {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\\) Binomial theorem: \\((1 + x)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} x^k\\) \\({n \\choose k}\\) is equal to the \\(k\\)th entry in the \\(n\\)th row of Pascal’s triangle. Note: Many of these idenetity may be proven using something called combinatorial proof. See Wiki for an (easy) example. Proof (4). \\[\\begin{align*} {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k} &amp;= \\frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)! (n-k)!} + \\frac{(n-1)!}{k! (n-k-1)!}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(n-1)!k }{(k-1)!

Stirling’s formula provides one such method, and it is given by \\[ n! \\sim \\sqrt{2 \\pi n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n, \\] where \\(\\sim\\) means their ratio approaches 1 as \\(n\\) goes to infinity.

Suppose that there are \\(n_1\\) objects which are of type 1, \\(n_2\\) which are of type 2, and in general \\(n_i\\) objects of type \\(i\\). Then there are \\[ \\frac{n!}{n_1 ! n_2! \\dots n_k !} \\] distinguishable arrangements of the \\(n\\) objects. This quantity is known as a multinomial coefficient and denoted by \\[ \\binom{n}{n_1,n_2,\\dots,n_k}= \\frac{n !}{n_1 ! n_2! \\dots n_k !}. \\] Note: Multinomial coefficient is an extension of the binomial coefficient. In binomial coefficient, there are only two groups/objects, and the first type has size \\(n_1\\) and the size of the second type is consequently \\(n-n_1\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of objects. Hence we have \\({n \\choose n_1} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! (n-n_1)!}\\). Try to compare this with the multinomial coefficient. 7.0.2 The Birthday Problem Suppose a room contains \\(n\\) people. What is the probability at least two people in the room share a birthday? Assumption: Suppose that each of the \\(n\\) people is equally likely to have any of the 365 days of the year as their birthday, so that all possible combinations of birthdays are equally likely. Let \\(A\\) be the event that at least two people share a birthday. Then \\[ P(A) = 1 - P(A^c),\\] where \\(A^c\\) is the event that nobody shares birthday with each other. For \\(n\\) people to have unique birthdays, we need to arrange them among 365 days w/o replacement. Thus, \\[|A^c| = 365^{(n)}.\\] For the size of the sample space, we see that each person has 365 possibilities for their birthday. Thus, \\[|S| = 365^n.\\] Since we are assuming that all possible combinations of birthdays are equally likely, our desired probability becomes \\[ P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - \\frac{365^{(n)}}{365^n} = 1 - \\frac{n! {365 \\choose n}}{365^n}. \\] For \\(n\\in\\{100, 30, 23\\}\\) we find \\[P(A_{100})= .9999997,\\;\\;\\; P(A_{30})=.7063 \\;\\;\\;\\; P(A_{23})=.5073.\\] 7.0.3 Chapter 4 Probbility Rules and Conditional Probability Review the Venn Diagram "],["lecture-7-january-22-2024.html", "8 Lecture 7, January 22, 2024", " 8 Lecture 7, January 22, 2024 8.0.1 Some terminology about the set thoery. 8.0.1.1 Fundamental law of set algebra Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be any arbitrary sets/events.

We often denote the range of a random variable \\(X\\) by \\(X(S)\\). ::: We say that, a random variable is discrete if its range \\(X(\\omega)\\) is discrete (finite or countable, in another word, we can say it is at most countable). We say, a sample space \\(S\\) is discrete if \\(S\\) is finite or countable. The sample space \\(S\\) and the range of the random variable are two different things, so do not get confused! We can have a discrete random variable while the sample space \\(S\\) is continuous! 12.2 Cumulative distribution function Definition 12.1 (Range) The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a random variable \\(X\\) is \\[ F_X(x) = P(X \\le x),\\;\\; x \\in {\\mathbb{R}}. \\] Note: The cumulative distribution function \\(F_X\\) is always defined over the entire real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), while the probability function may not always be defined! Hence, the cumulative distribution function is an useful tool! (but do not worry about it now.) Notation: \\(F_X(x) = P(X\\le x) = P(\\{\\omega \\in S : X(\\omega)\\in x\\}).\\) If \\(X\\) is discrete with probability function \\(f_X\\) (i.e. if \\(f_X\\) exists), then we can calculate the cdf from summing up the pdf as \\[ F_X(x)=P( X \\le x ) = \\sum_{y:\\; y\\le x}f_X(y). \\] 12.2.1 Properties of the cumulative distribution function Let \\(F_X(\\cdot)\\) be a cdf. Then the following holds \\(F_X(x)\\in [0,1]\\) \\(F_X(x) \\le F_x(y)\\) whenever \\(x&lt;y\\) (i.e. \\(F_X(\\cdot)\\) is a non-increasing function.) \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to - \\infty } F_X(x)=0\\), and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty } F_X(x) = 1\\). \\(F_X\\) is right continuous, i.e., \\(F(x_0)=\\lim_{x\\downarrow x_0} F(x)\\) for all \\(x_0\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). 12.3 Special distributions with names 12.3.1 Discrete uniform distribution The first named distribution we look at is the discrete uniform distribution Definition 12.2 (Discrete uniform distribution) uppose the range of the random variable \\(X\\) is \\(\\{a,a+1,\\dots, b\\}\\), where \\(a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\), and suppose all values are equally likely. Then we say that \\(X\\) has a discrete uniform distribution on \\(\\{a,a+1,\\dots,b\\}\\), shorthand: \\(X \\sim U[a,b]\\). 12.3.1.1 Probability function and distribution function If \\(X \\sim U[a,b]\\), then its probability function is given by \\[ f_X(x)= P(X = x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b - a + 1}, &amp;\\quad\\text{ if }x \\in\\{a,a+1,\\dots,b\\}, \\\\ 0, &amp;\\quad\\text{ otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] and corresponding (cumulative) distribution function is \\[ F_X(x)= P(X \\leq x) = \\begin{cases} 0, &amp;\\quad\\text{ if } x&lt;a\\\\ \\frac{\\lfloor x\\rfloor - a + 1}{b - a + 1}, &amp;\\quad\\text{ if }x \\in\\{a,a+1,\\dots,b\\}, \\\\ 1, &amp;\\quad\\text{ if } x\\geq b,\\end{cases} \\] where \\(\\lfloor x\\rfloor=\\max\\{z\\in\\mathbb{Z}: z\\leq x\\}\\) is the floor function.

Suppose that a subset of size \\(n\\) (with \\(n\\leq N\\)) is drawn from the population WITHOUT REPLACEMENT. Let \\(X\\)=Number of successes obtained, then we say \\(X\\) follows a hypergeometric distribution with parameters \\((N,r,n)\\). We sometimes write \\(X \\sim hyp(N,r,n)\\) or \\(X\\sim HG(N,r,n)\\). 13.1.1 Range of the Hypergeomnetric distribution We cannot have more successes than there are (\\(r\\)) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(x\\leq r\\) We cannot have more successes than trials (\\(n\\)) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(x\\leq n\\) When there are more trials than failures (\\(n&gt;(N-r)\\)) we will for sure have at least \\(n-(N-r)\\) successes \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(x\\geq \\max\\{0, n-(N-r)\\}\\). Overall, we have \\(\\max\\{0, n-(N-r)\\} \\leq x \\leq \\min\\{r,n\\}\\). 13.1.2 Probability function of hypergeometric distribution Total number of of subsets of size \\(n\\): \\(\\binom{N}{n}\\). Number of ways to select \\(x\\) successes out of \\(r\\) successes: \\(\\binom{r}{x}\\). Number of ways to choose remaining \\(n-x\\) failures from \\(N-r\\) failures: \\(\\binom{N-r}{n-x}\\). Thus, \\[f(x) = \\frac{\\binom{r}{x}\\binom{N-r}{n-x}}{\\binom{N}{n}},\\] where \\(\\max\\{0, n-(N-r)\\} \\leq x \\leq \\min\\{r,n\\}\\) and 0 otherwise. 13.2 Bernoulli and Binimial distributions Definition 13.2 (Bernoulli trail) A Bernoulli trial with probability of success \\(p\\) is an experiment that results in either a success or failure, and the probability of success is \\(p\\). Definition 13.3 (Bernoulli distribution) If a random variable \\(X\\) represents the number of successes in a Bernoulli trial with probability of success \\(p\\), it follows the Bernoulli distribution, and we denote it as \\[ X \\sim Bernoulli(p). \\] 13.2.1 Probability function and cumulative distribution function 13.2.2 Bernoulli If \\(X\\sim Bern(p)\\), the pf of \\(X\\) is \\[ f_X(0)=1-p,\\quad f_X(1)=p,\\quad f_X(x)=0\\,\\,\\text{ for }x\\not\\in\\{0,1\\}\\] and the cdf is \\[ F_X(x)=\\begin{cases} 0, &amp;\\text{ if }x&lt;0, \\\\ 1-p, &amp;\\text{ if } 0\\leq x &lt; 1,\\\\ 1, &amp;\\text{ if }x\\geq 1\\end{cases}\\] 13.2.3 Binomial Definition 13.4 (Bernoulli distribution) If we have \\(N\\) independent runs and record the numbers of successes obtained in these \\(n\\) runs, then \\(X\\) is said to have a binomial distribution, denoted by \\(X\\sim Bin(n,p)\\). Note: The probability function of \\(X\\sim Bin(n, p)\\) is \\[ f(x) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x},\\quad x=0,1,2,\\dots,n\\] and 0 otherwise. 13.3 Relationship and difference between binomial and hypergeometric Binomial and hypergeometric distributions are fundamentally different! In Binomial models, we pick WITH replacement, in the hypergeometric model WITHOUT replacement. If \\(N\\) is large and \\(n\\) is small, the chance we pick the same object twice is small. Thus, letting \\(r/N=p\\), \\(X\\sim Hyp(N,r,n)\\) and \\(Y\\sim Bin(n,p)\\), then we can APPROXIMATE \\[ P(X \\leq k) \\approx P(Y\\leq k).\\] (more precisely, in the limit as \\(N\\rightarrow\\infty\\) with \\(r/N\\rightarrow p\\) (the ratio of successes converges to the success probability). See pages 86/87 and later in the course for more. We’ll see an example next time.

Negative Binomial Binomial distribution: We know number of trials \\(n\\), but we do not know how many successes. Negative Binomial distribution: We know the number of successes \\(k\\), but we do not know how many trials will be needed. 14.4 Geometric distribution Definition 14.2 (Geometric) Consider an experiment with two possible outcomes success (Su) or failure (F). Without loss of generality, assume that the \\(P(Su)=p\\) (so \\(P(F)=1-P(Su)= 1-p\\)). Repeat the experiment independently before the 1st success has been observed. Denote \\(X\\) the number of failures before 1st success, then \\(X\\sim Geo(p)\\). Note: The Geometric distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution: \\(Geo(P) \\sim Neg(k=1,p)\\). 14.4.1 Probability function and distribution function If \\(X\\sim Geo(p)\\), then \\(X\\) has probability function \\[ f(x) = P(X=x)= (1-p)^x p,\\quad x\\in\\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}.\\] \\[ F(x)=P(X\\leq x) = P(X\\leq \\floor{x}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\floor{x}} (1-p)^k p = 1-(1-p)^{\\floor{x}+1}\\] if \\(x\\geq 0\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise.
