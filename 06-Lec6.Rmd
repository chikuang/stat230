::: {.definition name="Multinomial Coefficient"}
Consider $n$ objects which consist of $k$ types. Suppose that there are $n_1$ objects which are of type 1, $n_2$ which are of type 2, and in general $n_i$ objects of type $i$. Then there are
$$
\frac{n!}{n_1 ! n_2! \dots n_k !}
$$
distinguishable arrangements of the $n$ objects. This quantity is known as a **multinomial coefficient** and denoted by 
$$
\binom{n}{n_1,n_2,\dots,n_k}= \frac{n !}{n_1 ! n_2! \dots n_k !}.
